# pacman
Idea
Pacman but not at all pacman.
Fuck pacman, we keep the style but we change everything.

the player:
You are a nugget, from a top down view.
Your goal is to go to different abnormalities and collect Enkephalin modules from their mazes that they can create if you get a good score on your work.

Some abnormalities can have enemies inside those mazes and some give gifts when finishing mazes.

here's a sketch concept:
